# Classification-of-serum-samples-
This script was written by Robayet Chowdhury to develop SVM classifier models to classify infected and uninfected serum samples using the serum Antibody binding values generated from peptide microarrays.
Here, in each iteration, a SVM classifier can be trained on p-values (calculated from two disease cohorts) and samples labelled with binary numbers.Finally, SVM models developed in 
multiple iterations can be used to generate a ROC curve.

Requirements:
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
sklearn
scipy.stats
